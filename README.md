## Introduction

The **UAV_Sim_PyChrono** is a high-fidelity PyChrono-based simulator designed for multi-rotor UAVs (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles).


## Outlook on the Control Architecture

Autonomous UAVs with collinear propellers are inherently under-actuated. For this reason, the software includes:

- **Inner Loop**: Handles the rotational dynamics.
- **Outer Loop**: Handles the translational dynamics.

Both loops are governed by nonlinear equations of motion.

### Available Control Solutions

This software currently offers two control solutions for the inner and outer loops:

1. **Continuous-Time Feedback-Linearizing Control Law** combined with a **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Control Law**.
2. The above control law is augmented by a **Robust Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) System**, incorporating a simplified quadratic-in-the-velocity aerodynamic model.

For further details on these control architectures, refer to the publications found [here](https://www.acslstack.com/Journals).

Future versions of the software will include additional control systems.
